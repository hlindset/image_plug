## Project guidelines

- Use `mise exec -- ...` to run things in this repo with the correct versions of things
- Prefer the mise tasks for whole-repo workflows over invoking each tool by hand:
  - `mise run setup` installs Elixir (`mix deps.get`) and demo (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`) dependencies.
  - `mise run precommit` runs the Elixir gate: `mix format --check-formatted`, `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`, `mix credo --strict`, `mix test`. Run it before finishing broader changes.
  - `mise run precommit:demo` runs the Elixir gate plus the demo verify suite (`mix demo.verify`). Use it when a change also touches the `demo/` Svelte app.
- This project is a greenfield, unreleased library; backwards compatibility should not be a concern at this point in time
- Prefer shrinking unsupported API surface over preserving tidy errors for bad internal callers. If a code path exists only to define behavior for impossible internal misuse, delete that behavior and its test instead of adding guards, fallbacks, or replacement tests.
- When you remove something — a line, comment, doc note, code path, option, list entry — remove it cleanly. Don't leave a stray note in its place that explains, justifies, or narrates the removal, restates what used to be there, or points out what something is *not* (e.g. "X is no longer a span", "removed because…", or a parenthetical aside dangling after a trimmed list). The surrounding text should read as if the removed thing never existed; rationale for an edit belongs in the commit message, not the file.
- Before executing a new Superpowers design or implementation plan, run a parallel subagent review cycle on the plan. Use reviewers with disjoint focus areas, apply accepted feedback, rerun relevant doc checks, and commit the reviewed plan before implementation starts. When the change could observably affect a compatibility target's implementation — a parser option, output/encode behavior, an internal processing stage, or a deliberate divergence — at least one reviewer must focus on observable compatibility with the relevant target(s), imgproxy above all, checking that the resulting behavior matches the real upstream source (e.g. a local checkout of imgproxy's repository), not just internal correctness; when required it is in addition to, not instead of, other lenses, and more than one compatibility reviewer is fine. For changes that plainly don't touch any compatibility implementation (tooling, the demo/fiddle subproject, docs, build/CI, telemetry plumbing, or refactors with no observable behavior change), the compatibility reviewer is optional — pick lenses that fit the change.

## Native API guidelines

- Treat ImagePipe's native API as path-oriented and declarative. URL option order must not define processing order; parsing should produce an `ImagePipe.Plan`, and current parser/plan modules own the fixed transform order.
- Keep ImagePipe's core model product-neutral, while allowing deliberate compatibility targets when explicitly chosen. Compatibility parsers should translate into `ImagePipe.Plan` when semantics match cleanly; dialect-specific quirks should stay isolated in the parser/adapter layer and should not force ordered command semantics into the native API contract.
- Keep each compatibility target's conformance doc in sync with vendor-parity changes — the same discipline as the demo UI (Transform guidelines) and the default Logger (Telemetry guidelines). When a change alters how closely ImagePipe matches a compatibility target (a parser option, an output/encode behavior, an internal processing stage, or a deliberate divergence), update that target's conformance doc in the same change and have the compatibility reviewer (see the review-cycle rule above) confirm it. Note which axis changed: **surface** (the option/config tables), **stage/order** (the processing-pipeline section), or **behavioral/pixel** (the wire conformance tests and the "Diverges" notes). A behavior matching an internal upstream stage with no config knob (e.g. imgproxy `fixSize`) still belongs in the pipeline section even though it has no option-table row. imgproxy is the only target today (`docs/imgproxy_support_matrix.md`); future targets (Thumbor, imgix, TwicPics, Cloudinary, …) get their own `docs/<target>_*.md` and the same rule.

## Transform guidelines

- Keep transforms product-neutral and composable. Transform modules should express reusable image operations over `ImagePipe.Transform.State` with explicit parameter structs, not parser-specific or vendor-specific concepts; parsers for dialects such as imgproxy, Thumbor, TwicPics, imgix, Cloudinary, or any other product should translate their syntax into `ImagePipe.Plan` when semantics match cleanly, or remain isolated compatibility adapters when they need dialect-specific ordered behavior.
- Trust operation structs inside the transform boundary. A transform struct missing required callbacks is a programmer error; validation should validate operation fields, not prove that the module implements the transform behaviour.
- Decode is always opened `:sequential`; random access is provided per-operation. `ImagePipe.Transform.DecodePlanner` no longer chooses an access mode — it always opens sequential and only computes the shrink/scale load option. The cost of random access is paid per-op, lazily, by `ImagePipe.Transform.Chain`, which materializes the image to RAM (`copy_memory`, via `ImagePipe.Transform.Materializer`, tracked by `State.materialized?`) immediately before the first operation that needs it. An operation declares its need with the `requires_materialization?/1` behaviour callback (default `false`); only operations that genuinely require arbitrary pixel access (right-angle rotate, vertical/both flip, smart/object-detect crop) return `true`. EXIF auto-orient is the one self-managing exception, and is **not** a transform operation: it is carried as deferred `pending_orientation` state on `State` (`ImagePipe.Transform.PendingOrientation`) and applied late at the orientation-flush boundary (`ImagePipe.Transform.OrientationFlush`, after crop/resize with crop gravity + resize dimensions compensated into the storage frame), composing EXIF → user-rotate → user-flip (issue #146). Its materialization need is data-determined (the EXIF orientation header, which no op struct can see), so the flush self-materializes for EXIF orientations 3–8 (and any quarter/half-turn user rotate or vertical flip) and streams 1/2.
- Conservatism about sequential safety is preserved as a **test gate**, not a blanket random-access default. Before classifying an operation `requires_materialization?: false` (sequential-safe), it must be proven so by a per-op sequential-vs-random pixel-equivalence test opened from a genuinely streamed source (`access: :sequential`, `fail_on: :error` — not `from_binary`, which buffers) plus a property test over input shapes (sizes, orientations, sigmas); see `test/image_pipe/transform/sequential_access_test.exs`. The equivalence harness must include a self-check that a known-random op (e.g. a raw transpose) raises under the streamed open, so the comparison cannot pass tautologically. Materialization failures (`copy_memory`) are decode failures and must surface as `{:decode, _}` (→ 415), consistent between the mid-chain and delivery paths. The silent-buffering failure mode (libvips inserting a line/tile cache, yielding correct pixels but no memory win) is **not** covered by these correctness tests — it requires a memory high-water benchmark, currently deferred, so "no materialization" is a correctness-verified but not yet perf-verified claim.
- Keep the demo UI in sync with transform changes. When you add, remove, or change the parameters of a transform or a compatibility parser option, update the `demo/` Svelte app (controls and URL state) in the same change so the demo can exercise the new behavior end-to-end.

## Request safety guidelines

- Preserve request safety boundaries: parser and planner validation failures should return before source fetch or cache access, source fetching should use non-bang Req flows with bounded redirects/timeouts/content-type/body limits, and decoded input pixel limits should remain explicit.

## Cache guidelines

- Cache only successful encoded responses, with deterministic keys; cache errors fail open (a fail-closed opt-in such as `fail_on_cache_error` is not currently implemented — adapters reject it as an unknown option). Which fields compose the key is owned by `ImagePipe.Cache.Key` and its tests — read those rather than maintaining a field list here.
- The cache key and the ETag answer different questions; don't conflate their inputs. The **key** is storage identity: every input that can change the stored bytes or select a different stored variant, including the cachebuster and configured vary headers/cookies. The **ETag** is a strong byte-identity *validator*, deliberately narrower — it excludes the cachebuster and vary inputs, because changing those busts storage but yields byte-identical output and must not force a client to re-download identical content. Derive the ETag from request inputs (resolved source byte-identity seed + canonical plan + negotiated `Accept`), never from the stored output bytes: that is what lets a conditional GET return `304` before any source fetch, decode, encode, or cache read. Don't turn the ETag into a content hash of the body — it would regress that fast path.
- Neither the key nor the ETag is a generation gate. Keep safety limits (`max_body_bytes`, `max_input_pixels`, static result dimension limits) out of both: those decide whether a cache *miss* may generate a response, not whether an existing successful cached response may be served.
- Greenfield: don't bump internal cache key data versions for normal feature work or cache-shape changes. Reshape the canonical key data and update tests in place unless the code must still read or preserve old cache entries.

## Telemetry guidelines

- Treat telemetry as part of the runtime observability contract. Use `:telemetry.span/3`-style `:start`, `:stop`, and `:exception` event naming for request and meaningful stage spans.
- Keep telemetry metadata safe by default. The real constraint is *sensitivity* — not cardinality, and not whether a string looks path-shaped. Metadata fans out to every attached handler (including third-party exporters), so high-cardinality, product-neutral data is fine to emit: transform operation structs, decoded dimensions, class names, and identifiers like a detector's model-artifact name (e.g. a model filename) or a cache key. A value is not sensitive merely because it is a filename or path-derived — judge by whether the *specific* value carries a secret or reveals private end-user content, not by its shape. (Separately, and for *boundary* reasons rather than sensitivity: parser-internal/dialect structs and cache-internal shapes should not leak into events — see the namespace guidelines.) What is *actually* sensitive must not be emitted unless an explicit opt-in is designed and documented:
  - Secrets — signatures, tokens, credentials, API keys, or anything else that grants access.
  - Strings that routinely *embed* such secrets — above all full source URLs and request paths, which commonly carry signed-URL query params, signature segments, or presigned credentials. Emit these only behind a documented opt-in, or after stripping the secret-bearing parts.
  - Private end-user content or PII the host would not want fanned out to exporters.
- Cardinality is a consumer concern, not an emission concern: `Telemetry.Metrics` requires the metrics author to choose tags, and nothing forwards the raw metadata map to storage. Emit the data; let handlers project it.
- Keep third-party backend integrations out of the library: hosts attach AppSignal, OpenTelemetry, and metrics handlers themselves. ImagePipe may ship an opt-in default handler that uses only the stdlib `Logger` (`ImagePipe.Telemetry.attach_default_logger/1`); it is never attached automatically. The one exception is an opt-in, optional-dependency OTel *exporter* (`ImagePipe.Telemetry.Trace.OpenTelemetryExporter`) that ships adapter code only, compiles against `:opentelemetry_api` (optional), is never attached automatically, and uses only the public OTel API — the host still provides the SDK and configures the backend. Preserves "never automatic" and "no hard dep".
- Prefer shared telemetry helpers over ad hoc event emission so naming, measurements, metadata merging, and exception behavior stay consistent.
- Per-operation transform spans (`[:transform, :operation]`) are allowed for tracing execution structure (which operations ran, in what order). Their duration reflects pipeline *construction*, not pixel work — libvips is lazy — so never present per-operation duration as compute timing; keep honest aggregate timing on the coarse `[:transform, :execute]` stage span. Per-operation metadata carries the operation name (`:operation`) and position (`:index`), and may include the full operation struct (under the `:params` key) since it is derived from the public request and not sensitive; the default Logger shows the name and only dumps `:params` under `debug: true`.
- Keep the opt-in default Logger (`ImagePipe.Telemetry.Logger`) in sync with telemetry changes — the same way the demo UI tracks transform changes. When you add, remove, rename, or re-meta a telemetry event, update the Logger in the same change:
  - **Subscription.** A new event is invisible until it is added to `@group_span_events` (spans) or the one-shot lists (`@cache_oneshot`/`@transform_oneshot`). A renamed/removed event must be updated there too, or the Logger silently drops it or attaches to a dead name.
  - **Rendering.** Events with no specific `message/3` clause fall through to the generic clause, which prints `label` + `outcome(meta)` (i.e. `:result`). If you add a specific `message/3` clause, it **must still surface the outcome** — don't let a prettier message swallow `:result`/error state. Mind clause ordering: specific clauses come before the generic fallback.
  - **Levels.** If a new metadata value signals a failure/degradation, extend `level_for/3` (and `detect_fallback_warning?/2` for detection) so it escalates rather than logging at the base level.
  - **Coverage.** Add or update a `logger_test.exs` assertion for the new/changed line, and keep `docs/telemetry.md` aligned with both the events the Logger attaches to and what it renders.

## Namespace boundary guidelines

- Keep the canonical request model under `ImagePipe.Plan.*`.
- Keep parser behaviours and adapters under `ImagePipe.Parser.*`; parser-specific compatibility quirks should translate into `ImagePipe.Plan` or remain isolated in the parser/adapter layer.
- Keep request orchestration and runtime options under `ImagePipe.Request.*`.
- Keep source side effects and source identity under `ImagePipe.Source.*`.
- Keep response delivery under `ImagePipe.Response.*`.
- Keep output negotiation, format, policy, and encoding under `ImagePipe.Output.*`.
- Keep transform contracts, operation structs, state, decode planning, materialization, and cache material protocols under `ImagePipe.Transform.*`.
- Request, source, and response code must dispatch through `ImagePipe.Transform` and must not name concrete transform operation modules such as `ImagePipe.Transform.Scale`, `Cover`, `Contain`, `Crop`, or `Focus`.
- Boundary exports should stay narrow. Export behaviours and stable public/internal entry points, not implementation helpers.
- `ImagePipe.SimpleServer` is dev/test support only and must remain outside prod compilation.

## Boundary library guidelines

- Use `Boundary` declarations to enforce the namespace ownership described above. When adding or moving a top-level namespace, define its dependency direction explicitly instead of relying on implicit compile-time reachability.
- Keep `deps:` aligned with architecture direction. One line per namespace:
  - `parser` → `plan`
  - `request` → `plan`, `cache`, `source`, `output`, `response`, `telemetry`, generic transform execution contract
  - `source` → `plan` only (must not depend on `cache`, `response`, `parser`)
  - `cache` → `plan`, `output`, transform material
  - `output` → `plan`
  - `transform` → nothing in `parser`, `request`, `source`, `cache`, `output`, `response`
- Export only behaviours and stable public/internal entry points from each boundary. Do not export implementation helpers just to satisfy a compile error; move the helper to the correct boundary or add a narrow facade.
- Request, source, and response modules may call generic `ImagePipe.Transform` functions such as `transform_name/1` and `execute/2`, but must not alias or reference concrete operation modules. Parser and planner modules must emit semantic `ImagePipe.Plan.Operation.*` structs when translating syntax into a product-neutral plan.
- Boundary rule changes should come with focused architecture tests, especially for request/source/response code avoiding concrete transform modules and parser-specific structs.

## Elixir architecture guidelines

- Prefer Elixir extension points with explicit behaviours (`ImagePipe.Parser`, `ImagePipe.Transform`, `ImagePipe.Cache`), `@impl` annotations, typed parameter structs, and tagged `{:ok, value}` / `{:error, reason}` returns at runtime boundaries. Reserve raises for invalid initialization/configuration.
- Validate public options explicitly, preferably with `NimbleOptions` or adapter-owned `validate_options/1`, and reject unknown or malformed options before side effects.
- For trusted internal behaviour dispatch, call the callback directly and let missing callbacks raise. Do not add runtime duck-typing probes, callback-presence checks, or wrapper functions whose only purpose is to make impossible internal misuse return tidy errors.
- Constructor APIs should accept the narrowest shape that real callers use. Do not accept both keyword lists and maps, existing structs, or negative guard carve-outs such as `is_map(value) and not is_struct(value)` unless there is a real public caller or contract requiring it.
- Use pattern matching, small private functions, and `with`/`case` pipelines to keep success paths linear while preserving precise error tags. Avoid catch-all rescues unless a concrete runtime boundary intentionally degrades to a documented safe default; do not rescue trusted transform callback failures.

## Validation guidelines

Validation belongs at boundaries the caller doesn't control. Inside the codebase, trust what another module just produced.

**Validate:**

- Host configuration and option parsing (mount options, request options, parser config, adapter config).
- HTTP request input (headers, query strings, bodies, conditional-request fields).
- Cache reads from external storage and other data crossing a serialization boundary.
- Third-party API responses.
- Return values from host-implementable behaviours such as `ImagePipe.Source`, `ImagePipe.Parser`, and `ImagePipe.Cache` adapters.

**Don't validate:**

- Struct fields already guaranteed by `@enforce_keys` (the struct can't exist without them).
- Values another module in this codebase just constructed and handed you.
- Properties a structural check can't actually prove (determinism, semantic stability, secret-freeness). Document the contract in `@moduledoc`/`@doc` and assert it in producer tests instead.
- Hypothetical future callers that don't exist yet — add the validation when the future caller appears, with a test that exercises it.

**Rule of thumb:** if tempted to add a guard, ask whether the value's producer is in this repo. If yes, write a test against the producer instead. If no, validate at the boundary where the value enters.

**Removing a guard at a real boundary counts as a behavior change.** Justify with a producer test or an unreachable-from-callers analysis, not "it looks unused".

## Elixir guidelines

- Elixir lists **do not support index based access via the access syntax**

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      mylist[i]

  Instead, **always** use `Enum.at`, pattern matching, or `List` for index based list access, ie:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      Enum.at(mylist, i)

- Elixir variables are immutable, but can be rebound, so for block expressions like `if`, `case`, `cond`, etc
  you _must_ bind the result of the expression to a variable if you want to use it and you CANNOT rebind the result inside the expression, ie:

      # INVALID: we are rebinding inside the `if` and the result never gets assigned
      if connected?(socket) do
        socket = assign(socket, :val, val)
      end

      # VALID: we rebind the result of the `if` to a new variable
      socket =
        if connected?(socket) do
          assign(socket, :val, val)
        end

- **Avoid** nesting multiple modules in the same file as it can cause cyclic dependencies and compilation errors
- **Never** use map access syntax (`changeset[:field]`) on structs as they do not implement the Access behaviour by default. For regular structs, you **must** access the fields directly, such as `my_struct.field` or use higher level APIs that are available on the struct if they exist.
- Elixir's standard library has everything necessary for date and time manipulation. Familiarize yourself with the common `Time`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Calendar` interfaces by accessing their documentation as necessary. **Never** install additional dependencies unless asked or for date/time parsing (which you can use the `date_time_parser` package)
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Predicate function names should not start with `is_` and should end in a question mark. Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards
- Elixir's builtin OTP primitives like `DynamicSupervisor` and `Registry`, require names in the child spec, such as `{DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.MyDynamicSup}`, then you can use `DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MyApp.MyDynamicSup, child_spec)`
- Use `Task.async_stream(collection, callback, options)` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure. The majority of times you will want to pass `timeout: :infinity` as option

## Mix guidelines

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mise exec -- mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mise exec -- mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mise exec -- mix test --failed`
- Run `mise exec -- mix credo --strict` to lint the codebase.
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason
- Before finishing code changes, run the relevant focused tests through `mise exec -- ...`; for broader behavioral or public API changes, also run `mise exec -- mix test` and `mise exec -- mix compile --warnings-as-errors`.

## Test guidelines

### When to add tests

- For behavior changes, add focused ExUnit coverage at the relevant boundary: parser grammar/order-insensitivity, planner mapping, plug-level no-source-fetch failures, output negotiation including `Vary: Accept`, cache key/corruption behavior, and source/decode limit handling.
- For compatibility parsers such as imgproxy, add a compact set of wire-level Plug tests when changing request parsing, planning, output negotiation, caching, or safety behavior. These tests should make real `ImagePipe.call/2` requests and assert user-visible contracts such as status, headers, content type, decoded output dimensions, cache/source access, and response-body equivalence where relevant.
- When a request option should visibly change image pixels, include a request-boundary test that decodes the response body and compares pixels against a plain or otherwise appropriate baseline. Cover the no-geometry form separately when the option must work without resize, crop, canvas, or padding. Parser structs and transform-unit assertions are not enough for these changes.
- Keep wire-level compatibility tests representative, not exhaustive. Use them for public contracts such as option-order equivalence, `Accept` negotiation and `Vary`, explicit output formats bypassing negotiation, representative geometry results, request-safety failures before source/cache access, and cache reuse for semantically equivalent requests. Leave grammar edge cases and combinatorial coverage in parser, planner, cache-key, and property tests.
- Add StreamData property tests when correctness depends on invariants across many input shapes or orderings, such as canonicalization, filesystem safety, parser order-insensitivity, cache keys, normalization, and round-trip behavior. Keep focused example tests for specific edge cases and error messages.

### Tests not to write

**Rule of thumb:** before writing a test, ask whether a real producer in this repo can construct the input you are about to assert on. If no in-repo producer creates that shape, you are testing impossible misuse — delete the production code path instead of pinning it with a test. Tests follow the same boundary discipline as validation (see *Elixir architecture guidelines*): assert at boundaries the caller doesn't control, trust what another module in this codebase just produced.

- **No impossible-internal-misuse tests.** Do not hand-build internal structs (parser ops, transform operations, plan pipelines, cache entries) that no real producer in this codebase constructs, just to assert that a validator rejects them or that a negative guard branch fires. Hand-built `%ImagePipe.Transform.Operation.Resize{}`, `%ImagePipe.Plan.Pipeline{}`, or parser-internal struct literals outside parser/planner test files are a strong signal.
- **No name- or existence-policing tests.** Do not assert that a module exists, that a function is exported (`function_exported?/3`, `Code.ensure_loaded?/1`), or that a stale module remains deleted. If a real caller needs the function, that caller's test already exercises it; if no real caller exists, the test is policing a name.
- **No post-migration parity pins.** After a rename or refactor lands, delete the parity, characterization, and "old vs new" tests added to pin it during the transition. Keep them only if they cover behavior no other test asserts. Files named `*_characterization_test.exs` in this greenfield codebase are a smell — they usually mean the refactor is done and the pin has lost its purpose.
- **No private-implementation tests.** Do not assert on exact private validation error strings, bang vs non-bang spellings, or other private helper choices. Test the runtime contract, not the implementation path that satisfies it.
- **No source-text scanning outside architecture tests.** Reading `.ex` files to grep for forbidden references is allowed only in `test/image_pipe/architecture_boundary_test.exs`, and only to enforce namespace boundaries (e.g. request code must not name concrete transform modules). Anywhere else, source scanning is a smell.

### Process discipline

- **Always use `start_supervised!/1`** to start processes in tests as it guarantees cleanup between tests
- **Avoid** `Process.sleep/1` and `Process.alive?/1` in tests
  - Instead of sleeping to wait for a process to finish, **always** use `Process.monitor/1` and assert on the DOWN message:

    ref = Process.monitor(pid)
    assert_receive {:DOWN, ^ref, :process, ^pid, :normal}

  - Instead of sleeping to synchronize before the next call, **always** use `_ = :sys.get_state/1` to ensure the process has handled prior messages
