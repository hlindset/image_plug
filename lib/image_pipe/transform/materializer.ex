defmodule ImagePipe.Transform.Materializer do
  @moduledoc """
  Materialization boundary for transform execution.

  `materialize/1` delegates to `ImagePipe.Transform.OrientationFlush.flush/1`,
  which applies any pending orientation (EXIF auto-rotate plus user rotate/flip)
  before copying the current image to a RAM-resident buffer and marking the state
  `materialized?: true`. Materialization may therefore change the displayed frame
  (when orientation was deferred) in addition to copying pixels to memory.

  Per-op materialization (`ImagePipe.Transform.Chain`) calls this before the
  first operation that requires random access, so a sequential decode can stream
  through earlier ops and only copy when an op genuinely needs arbitrary pixel
  access. `Request.Processor.materialize_for_delivery/2` also calls the arity-2
  callback form once before delivery for any chain that never materialized
  mid-pipeline.

  `materialize/1` emits a `[:transform, :materialize]` telemetry span around the
  flush, giving honest per-barrier timing regardless of which call site triggered
  the materialization.
