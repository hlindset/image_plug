defmodule ImagePipe.Transform.State do
  @moduledoc """
  Execution state carried through a transform chain.

  State holds the current image and debug flag used by product-neutral
  operations. Operations return an updated state instead of mutating images in
  place.

  Injected runtime configuration also rides on the state so operations can reach
  host-provided collaborators without naming concrete request modules:

  - `detector`: host-configured content detector, either a bare `module` or a
    `{module, opts}` pair, or `nil` when no detector is configured.
  - `detector_required`: whether detect-gravity must use the detector instead of
    silently falling back to attention smartcrop.
  - `telemetry_opts`: telemetry metadata threaded through stage spans.
  - `source_dimensions`: the *exact* original (full-resolution) `{w, h}` the
    residual resize must size against, set only when shrink-on-load has reduced the
    decoded image; `nil` otherwise. It is exact (not reconstructed from the shrunk
    dims), so the residual resize lands on the same target as a full-resolution
    decode. It stays in the storage frame — EXIF/user orientation is carried as a
    pending rotation on `pending_orientation` and flushed after the resize, so no
    pre-resize op swaps these dimensions. A preceding crop or quarter-turn rotate no
    longer declines shrink-on-load (#151); the resize target is expressed against the
    cropped/displayed axes instead (see `ImagePipe.Transform.DecodePlanner`). The
    residual resize clears it to `nil` (alongside `decode_shrink`), and a crop reached
    before the resize clears both as well (the cropped live image is then the frame
    the resize sizes against) — so neither survives into a later pipeline.
  - `decode_shrink`: the *realized* per-axis shrink factor `%{w: float, h: float}`
    (each `>= 1.0`, original ÷ decoded) actually applied by shrink-on-load, or `nil`
    when the decode was full-resolution. A crop preceding the resize rescales its
    absolute pixel dims and pixel/absolute gravity offsets by this factor so the
    crop selects the same source region on the shrunk image that it would at full
    resolution; relative (ratio/percent/focus-point) coordinates are untouched.
    For JPEG block shrink and WebP scale-on-load the factor is uniform across axes.
    It is a storage-frame factor, so a gravity crop carrying a pending quarter-turn
    swaps the per-axis factors before rescaling (the display-frame crop dims are
    swapped into the storage frame after — `ImagePipe.Transform.PlanExecutor`).
  - `source_color_profile` and `color_imported?`: carry the input-color-management
    result from the preamble (`ImagePipe.Transform.InputColorManagement`) to the
    delivery-boundary stamp. `source_color_profile` is the raw source ICC bytes
    (or `nil`), and `color_imported?` indicates whether an actual `icc_import` ran.
    Transform-domain data; must never be emitted in telemetry metadata.

  Dimensions the residual resize must size against.

  When shrink-on-load reduced the decoded image, this returns the exact stored
  original extent (`source_dimensions`), so the residual resize computes the same
  target a full-resolution decode would. With no shrink it returns the live image
  dimensions — which also makes a crop-before-resize correct, since the cropped
  image's own dimensions are what the following resize should size against.
