  # A quarter-turn rotate (90°/270°) or a vertical flip reads its source out of
  # row order, which the lazy `access: :sequential` decode (DecodePlanner) cannot
  # satisfy: applying the orientation to a streamed source and then `copy_memory`
  # trips the sequential-access wall ("Failed to memory copy image") once the
  # image is large enough that libvips can't silently buffer it. So when the
  # pending orientation needs arbitrary pixel access, materialize the *un-rotated*
  # image to RAM first (mirroring the old eager AutoOrient), giving the rotate a
  # random-access source. A plain sequential read into RAM always succeeds; the
  # rotate then runs over the buffer and the trailing copy_memory holds.
  #
  # `apply_orientation` runs the EXIF autorotate (exif_angle rotation + an hflip
  # when exif_flip_x) and the user rotate as SEPARATE libvips ops. EACH stage that
  # rotates 90/180/270 — or vertically flips — reads its source out of row order
  # and independently needs a random-access source. The intermediate result of one
  # such stage is itself a lazy pipeline node over the sequential decode, so it is
  # not enough to look at the NET combined angle: when an EXIF quarter/half-turn
  # and a user rotate cancel (net 0 mod 360) the per-stage rotations still execute
  # and still trip the wall. The predicate must therefore fire whenever ANY
  # individual stage needs random access: the EXIF rotation (`exif_angle != 0`,
  # catching EXIF orientations 3-8), the user rotation (`user_angle != 0`), or a
  # vertical flip (`user_flip_y`).
  #
  # Identity and pure horizontal mirrors stay sequential-safe — they read rows in
  # order — so they skip the pre-copy and preserve the streaming fast path: EXIF
  # orientations 1/2 have `exif_angle == 0` (1 is identity, 2 is hflip) and a
  # user hflip alone leaves all three angle/flip-y fields zero. This mirrors #143's
  # classification (only EXIF orientations 1/2 stream; 3-8 materialize). A pre-copy
  # is pixel-identity, so an over-eager pre-copy would only cost perf; the per-stage
  # predicate is chosen to never UNDER-fire (no remaining holes) while still keeping
  # the streaming path for the genuinely row-ordered cases.
