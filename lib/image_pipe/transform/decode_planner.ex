defmodule ImagePipe.Transform.DecodePlanner do
  @moduledoc """
  Chooses image decode load options for semantic Plan operations.

  Decode is always opened with `:sequential` access. Random access is provided
  per-op by `ImagePipe.Transform.Chain` when individual operations require it.

  The planner also computes a format-specific load shrink/scale option for
  large downscales.

  The planner is a pure function: it does not read image metadata itself.
  The caller (Request.Processor) reads the header dims and source format and
  passes them in.

  # --- Shrink/scale computation ---

  # The load shrink must never decode the image *below* the residual resize's
  # target on either axis — otherwise that resize would upscale a shrunk image and
  # produce a softer result than the full-decode path. We therefore compute the
  # shrink against the residual resize's *effective* target, which `dpr` and `zoom`
  # inflate.
  #
  # A crop reaching the chain before the resize is allowed through (#151): the crop
  # reduces the pixels feeding the resize, so the shrink is sized against the
  # *cropped* extent — `min(crop_dim, src_dim)` per axis — never the full source,
  # which would over-shrink the cropped region. The crop's absolute pixel dims and
  # gravity offsets are rescaled by the realized shrink at execution time
  # (PlanExecutor); relative (ratio/percent/focus-point) crops shrink in place and
  # need no coordinate rescale.
  #
  # A quarter-turn rotate reaching the chain before the resize is also allowed
  # through (#151): orientation is deferred (#146) and flushed *after* the residual
  # resize, so the stored axes still feed the resize; the only adjustment is that
  # the resize target is expressed against the *displayed* axes, which `shrink_axes`
  # already swaps when the combined net turn (EXIF ∘ user rotate) is a quarter turn.
  # The realized shrink scalar is unchanged by a rotate, so B1's crop-coordinate
  # rescale at execution still applies verbatim.
  #
  # `min_width`/`min_height` remain ineligible — they enlarge the result to a floor,
  # interacting with aspect ratio in ways that are not a simple per-axis multiplier;
  # `resize_load_shrink/3` returns `1.0` for that shape, so it never shrinks.
  #
  # Declining to shrink is always safe — it forgoes the memory win, never quality.
