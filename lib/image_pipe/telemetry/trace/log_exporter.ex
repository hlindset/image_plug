defmodule ImagePipe.Telemetry.Trace.LogExporter do
  @moduledoc """
  Stdlib `Logger` exporter: one flat structured line per completed span.

  Stateless by design — it does NOT buffer spans into a tree or wait for a root
  to close. Each span is logged on its own as `:stop`/`:exception` fires, in the
  process that emitted it. Parentage is carried in the `parent=` field so a
  downstream log pipeline can reconstruct nesting; this exporter never holds
  state between spans.
