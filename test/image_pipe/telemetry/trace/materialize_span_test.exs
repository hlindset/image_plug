  # The [:transform, :materialize] barrier span fires once per flush, wherever the
  # flush happens. There are THREE distinct nesting parents in practice, all covered
  # below:
  #
  #   1. mid-chain, before a random-access op (e.g. a smart crop) -> parent is the
  #      [:transform, :operation] span (Chain.maybe_materialize, inside run_operation);
  #   2. a pipeline-boundary flush of a still-pending EXIF orientation (PlanExecutor),
  #      which runs inside [:transform, :execute] but not under any single operation ->
  #      parent is the [:transform, :execute] span;
  #   3. the delivery backstop (Processor.materialize_for_delivery/2), which runs AFTER
  #      [:transform, :execute] has closed -> parent is the request root.
  #
  # (Every successful request materializes at least once: a chain that never
  # materializes mid-pipeline hits the delivery backstop, so there is no "zero
  # materialize spans" outcome to assert.)

  # EXIF-orientation-6 source (40x80 stored, displayed 80x40 after autorotate). A
