  # Each orientation is the same 400×300 corner-block base retagged with a
  # different EXIF Orientation. The Batch-A shape (cover / non-center crop /
  # extend-with-gravity) hits the per-axis storage↔display dims, the crop-gravity
  # rotate-into-storage, and the post-flush gravity seams respectively. The extend
  # target is 200:300 (not square) so south gravity keeps real vertical play on the
  # portrait-display quarter-turns. 5/7 (transpose/transverse) additionally cross
  # with a user op (rot/flip) — the deepest #146 compose, flip ∘ quarter-turn ∘
  # user-op. Orientation 6 is omitted from the sweep — it is already covered by
  # the `rotate_exif`/`strip_exif` cases above (its source `:exif_6` lives in
  # `@source_files` for them).
