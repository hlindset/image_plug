defmodule ImagePipe.Test.ImgproxyDifferential.SourceInventory do
  @moduledoc """
  Single source of truth for the committed differential test images
  (`sources/`). Each entry records a source's verifiable facts (dims, bands,
  format, interpretation, embedded-profile presence) plus how it is produced, who
  consumes it, and what invariant it must preserve.

  **The verifiable facts are drift-checked** by
  `test/image_pipe/imgproxy_source_inventory_test.exs`, which decodes every file
  and fails if the inventory and the bytes disagree, if a source is added/removed
  without an entry, or if a constellation references an uninventoried source.

  ## Keep this in sync

  Adding, removing, or regenerating a source REQUIRES updating its entry here — the
  drift test fails otherwise. A regeneration that changes any recorded fact (a
  libvips bump, a content change) is a deliberate act: update the entry, re-bake
  (`mise run diff:bake`), and review the consumers below. See the differential
  README's "Source inventory" section.

  `produced_by`:
    * `:gen_sources` — emitted by `mix imgproxy.gen_sources` (the only way to
      regenerate it; running the task overwrites EVERY such file, so `git status
      sources/` afterward and confirm only the intended files changed).

  `consumers` beyond the differential conformance suite (these are the
  cross-couplings that make a source change ripple outside the bake — e.g. the
  color-management tests depend on a source carrying an embedded ICC profile):
    * `:icm` — `test/image_pipe/transform/input_color_management_test.exs`
    * `:icm_sequential` —
      `test/image_pipe/transform/input_color_management_sequential_test.exs`
    * `:color_result` — `test/image_pipe/output/color_result_test.exs`
    * `:wire` — `test/image_pipe/imgproxy_wire_conformance_test.exs`
  Every source is also consumed by the differential suite via `Constellations`.
