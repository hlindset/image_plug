# Cross-process `assert_receive {:DOWN, ...}` liveness checks (e.g. the
# SourceSession.Producer tests) can exceed the default 100ms budget under CI
# scheduler load (oversubscribed cores plus libvips/NIF work on dirty
# schedulers), producing flaky timeouts. Give those waits more slack; it does
# not slow down the passing path, which delivers the message near-instantly.
# `:imgproxy_triage` quarantines recorded-but-unresolved imgproxy differential
# discrepancies (see the lane README + issues #194-#197); run them with
# `--include imgproxy_triage`.
# `:imgproxy_report` is the full-constellation HTML report render (bakes every
# constellation + inlines PNGs); it is an integration/report job, not unit
# coverage, so it is opt-in via `--include imgproxy_report` (or `mix
# imgproxy.gen_report`). Its rendering logic is unit-tested separately.
