# TwicPics support matrix

This matrix compares ImagePipe's `ImagePipe.Parser.TwicPics` support with the
[TwicPics media transformation API](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/essentials/api.md).

ImagePipe treats TwicPics URLs as a compatibility parser for a product-neutral
`ImagePipe.Plan`. Supported transformations translate cleanly into canonical
plan / output / cache / response fields. Unsupported transformations fail before
source fetch or cache lookup — ImagePipe doesn't ignore them.

Unlike the imgproxy dialect — whose URLs are order-insensitive, with its parser
emitting a fixed-order pipeline regardless of option order — the TwicPics dialect
is **order-dependent**: transformations apply in chain order and relative units
(`p`, `s`) resolve against the running dimensions (`resize=340/resize=50p` →
170px). ImagePipe's `Plan` is an ordered pipeline by design, so this maps
directly; the TwicPics-specific quirks stay isolated in the parser and the Plan
carries only product-neutral relative dimension units.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Supported | The parser translates this into `ImagePipe.Plan` or another request facet. |
| 📋 Planned (v1) | Scoped for the first iteration, not yet implemented. Flip to ✅ when it lands. |
| ⚠️ Partial | Some TwicPics syntax or semantics supported, but not the whole option. |
| 🔗 URL-only | Supported as a request option, but not a TwicPics dashboard / config default. |
| 🧩 Host-owned | Plug, router, or web-server configuration owns this outside ImagePipe. |
| 🚫 Rejected | Recognized and intentionally unsupported; returns an error before side effects. |
| ⭕ Missing | Not implemented and not yet scoped. |
| 🛑 Out of scope | Excluded from ImagePipe's library surface (e.g. video). |

## URL shape, source, and configuration

| TwicPics feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `?twic=v1/<chain>` query parameter | 📋 Planned (v1) | Required `v1/` prefix; chain is an ordered `/`-separated list of `name=args`. `twic` may appear anywhere in the query string. |
| Ordered chaining | 📋 Planned (v1) | Transformations apply in order; later transforms see earlier results. Modeled as an ordered `Plan` pipeline executed sequentially. |
| Running-dimension relative units (`p`, `s`) | 📋 Planned (v1) | Resolved against the running image at execution time, not statically at parse. Requires an additive `Plan.Operation.Resize` dimension widening. |
| Static chain collapse / shadowing | ⭕ Missing | TwicPics collapses redundant transforms (`resize=340/resize=50p` → `resize=170`). Deferred optimization, **not** correctness: v1 runs each op and resolves relative units at runtime. Collapse is sound only when operands are literal *and* the intermediate dimension is provably fixed. Buys perf + sharpness (avoids double resampling). |
| Path → source resolution | 📋 Planned (v1) | `conn.path_info` resolves to a `Plan.Source` reusing the imgproxy path-source origin mechanism. |
| Multi-origin [path configuration](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/essentials/path-configuration.md) | ⭕ Missing | Prefix → origin mapping. Out of scope for v1; single configured origin only. |
| [Domain configuration](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/essentials/domain-configuration.md) | 🧩 Host-owned | Dashboard domain setup has no ImagePipe equivalent; the host router/Plug owns mounting. |
| URL signature / path protection | ⭕ Missing | Not modeled for TwicPics yet. |

## Transformations

Mapped against [API Transformations](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/transformations.md).

| TwicPics transform | Status | Notes / Plan mapping |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resize=W` | 📋 Planned (v1) | Single dim → `Resize(:fit, W, :auto)`, preserves aspect. |
| `resize=WxH` | 📋 Planned (v1) | Exact dims, may distort → `Resize(:stretch, …)` (= imgproxy `force`). |
| `resize=W:H` (ratio) | 🚫 Rejected | Surface-preserving resize-to-ratio has no clean mapping to an existing op; deferred with its own operation design. |
| `resize-max` / `resize-min` | 🚫 Rejected | Conditional variants deferred; recognized and rejected. |
| `cover=WxH` | 📋 Planned (v1) | `Resize(:cover, …, guide: focus)` — fill + crop to focus. |
| `cover=W:H` (ratio) | 📋 Planned (v1) | `CropGuided(:full_axis, :full_axis, aspect_ratio: …, guide: focus)` — largest matching-ratio area. |
| `cover-max` / `cover-min` | 🚫 Rejected | Conditional variants deferred. |
| `contain=WxH` | 📋 Planned (v1) | `Resize(:fit, …)` — fits inside, may be smaller, no letterbox. |
| `contain-max` / `contain-min` (aliases `max` / `min`) | 🚫 Rejected | Conditional variants deferred. |
| `inside=WxH` | ⚠️ Partial (v1) | `Resize(:fit, …)` + `Canvas(W, H, placement: center, fill: transparent)` — letterboxed to exact dims. **Transparent fill only**; user-specified `background` deferred. Non-alpha output (e.g. `output=jpeg`) flattens the letterbox (documented, tested). |
| `inside=W:H` (ratio) | 🚫 Rejected | Ratio form deferred (same reason as `resize=W:H`). |
| `crop=WxH` | 📋 Planned (v1) | `CropGuided(W, H, guide: focus)`. Crop-size: an omitted dim / `-` means `1s` = full running axis (`:full_axis`), not aspect-preserving auto. |
| `crop=WxH@XxY` | 📋 Planned (v1) | `CropRegion(x: X, y: Y, width: W, height: H)`; resets focus → center. |
| `focus=<coords>` / `focus=<anchor>` | 📋 Planned (v1) | Sets the current guide for the next `cover` / `crop`; emits no operation. |
| `focus=auto` | 🚫 Rejected | Smart / content-aware (ML-ish) subject detection; no model. Consistent with rejecting imgproxy `g:sm`. A future `:smart` guide (libvips attention/entropy) could satisfy both. |
| `focus=center` | 🚫 Rejected | `center` is not a TwicPics anchor literal — it is only the default focus. Rejected as a literal in v1 for fidelity; candidate lenient extension later. |
| `zoom=N` | 🚫 Rejected | Deferred; `Resize` already has `zoom_x` / `zoom_y` so a fast follow is cheap. |
| `flip=x\|y\|both` | 🚫 Rejected | Deferred; maps to `Flip`. |
| `turn=<angle>` | 🚫 Rejected | Deferred; maps to `Rotate` (right-angle multiples). |
| `background=<color>` / `background=remove` | 🚫 Rejected | Color chaining deferred; `remove` needs AI background removal. |
| `border=<color>` | 🚫 Rejected | Color chaining deferred. |
| `colorize=…` | 🚫 Rejected | Color chaining deferred. |
| `achromatopsia` / `deuteranopia` / `protanopia` / `tritanopia` | 🚫 Rejected | Experimental color-blindness corrections; deferred. |
| `refit-cover` / `refit-inside` | 🚫 Rejected | Content-aware resizing; deferred. |
| `truecolor` | 🚫 Rejected | PNG quantization control; deferred. |
| `download` | ⭕ Missing | Forces browser download; `Response` disposition could model it later. |
| `noop` | ⭕ Missing | Pass-through; deferred. |
| `duration` / `from` / `to` | 🛑 Out of scope | Video slicing. ImagePipe treats video as out of scope. |

## Output and encoding

Mapped against [API Parameters](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/parameters.md).

| TwicPics feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `output=auto` | 📋 Planned (v1) | `Plan.Output` `:automatic` — Accept-negotiated, emits `Vary: Accept`. |
| `output=avif\|webp\|jpeg\|png` | 📋 Planned (v1) | Explicit `{:explicit, format}`, bypasses negotiation. |
| `output=heif` | ⭕ Missing | Not in the v1 explicit-format set. |
| `output=blurhash\|preview\|maincolor\|meancolor\|blank` | 🚫 Rejected | Non-image preview outputs; deferred. |
| `output=h264\|h265\|vp9` | 🛑 Out of scope | Video output codecs. |
| `quality=1..100` | 📋 Planned (v1) | `Plan.Output` quality. |
| `quality-max` / `quality-min` | 🚫 Rejected | Conditional variants deferred. |

## Parameter types

Mapped against [API Parameters](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/parameters.md). These are the value grammars the transformations above consume.

| TwicPics type | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Length (px / `p` percent / `s` scale) | 📋 Planned (v1) | `{:px, n}` / `{:percent, n}` / `{:scale, f}`. Bare number = pixels. |
| Size (`WxH`, `-` auto) | 📋 Planned (v1) | One dimension may be `-` for auto. Mixed units allowed. |
| Ratio (`W:H`) | 📋 Planned (v1) | Two strictly-positive numbers → `{:ratio, n, d}`. |
| Coordinates (`XxY`) | 📋 Planned (v1) | Focus point; two Lengths. |
| Anchor (8 named positions) | 📋 Planned (v1) | `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, four corners → Plan guides. No `center` anchor — `center` is the default focus only. |
| Crop size | 📋 Planned (v1) | Distinct from Size: omitted dim / `-` means `1s` = full running axis (`:full_axis`), **not** aspect-preserving auto. `crop=320` ≡ `320x-` ≡ `320x1s`. |
| Number with expressions `(1/3)`, `+ - * /` | 🚫 Rejected | Arithmetic engine deferred; only decimal literals in v1. |
| Color (names / hex / rgb / hsl / alpha) | 🚫 Rejected | Used by color chaining; deferred. |
| Angle (number / named) | 🚫 Rejected | Used by `turn`; deferred. |
| Axis (`x` / `y` / `both`) | 🚫 Rejected | Used by `flip`; deferred. |
| Boolean (`true`/`yes`/`on` …) | ⭕ Missing | No v1 transform consumes a boolean yet. |
| Padding (CSS-style shorthand) | ⭕ Missing | No v1 transform consumes padding yet. |

## Placeholders and Native

| TwicPics feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Placeholders API](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/placeholders.md) | ⭕ Missing | LQIP / placeholder generation; out of scope for v1. |
| [TwicPics Native attributes](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/native-attributes.md) | 🛑 Out of scope | Client-side frontend attribute system, not a server URL API. |
